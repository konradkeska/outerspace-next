# Outerspace Next

Dark high contrast theme with fluo green as main color, really good for those who like to code at night.

This theme is a mix-up of popular themes I've used before but I felt something was missing in each one of those, my biggest inspiration was:

- **Night Owl**

but, also:

- **Cyber Punk**
- **Oceanic Next**
- **Cobalt2**
- **Nord**

This theme is sort of a mix up of the ones I listed above. Basically I just took what I liked the most from those themes and customised it a little more.
