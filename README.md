Dark high contrast theme with fluo green as main color, really good for those who like to code at night.

This theme is a mix-up of popular themes I've used before but I felt something was missing in each one of those, my biggest inspiration was:

- **Night Owl**

but, also:

- **Cyber Punk**
- **Oceanic Next**
- **Cobalt2**
- **Nord**

This theme is sort of a mix up of the ones I listed above. Basically I just took what I liked the most from those themes and customised them a little more.

## Syntax support

I've tested so far:

- **JavaScript**
- **CSS**
- **SCSS**
- **SASS**
- **LESS**
- **C#**

If you feel like something is missing, open an issue or write to me, I will gladly consider some modifications.

# Installation

1. Open **Extensions** sidebar panel in VS Code. `View â†’ Extensions`
2. Search for `Outerspace Next`
3. Click **Install**
4. Click **Reload**
5. Code > Preferences > Color Theme > **Outerspace Next**

## Contribution

If you don't like something or have some proposals feel free to open an issue, I'll get to it as soon as possible.
