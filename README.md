Dark high contrast theme with fluo green as main color, really good for those who like to code at night.

This theme is a mix-up of popular themes I've used before but I felt something was missing in each one of those, my biggest inspiration was:

- [**Night Owl**](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme)

but, also:

- [**Cyber Punk**](https://github.com/prometheux-ar/cyberpunk)
- [**Oceanic Next**](https://github.com/mhartington/oceanic-next)
- [**Cobalt2**](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode)
- [**Nord**](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord)

This theme is sort of a mix up of the ones I listed above. Basically I just took what I liked the most from those themes and customised them a little more.

## Syntax support

I've tested so far:

- **JavaScript**
- **CSS**
- **SCSS**
- **SASS**
- **LESS**
- **C#**

If you feel like some language syntax is missing, open an issue or write to me, I will add it.
